# Google Play Asset Delivery Plugin for Unity

## Overview

Google Play Plugins for Unity provide C# APIs for accessing Play in-game features from within the Unity Engine. These plugins also provide Unity Editor features for building a game before publishing it on Google Play.  

Play Asset Delivery enables AssetBundles and other assets to be packaged into an Android App Bundle and delivered through Google Play.

Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery/integrate-unity) and [Runtime API reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/unity/namespace/Google/Play/AssetDelivery) for more information.

## Known issues
### Play Asset Delivery support built into Unity

Recent versions of Unity, such as 2019.4.29, 2020.3.15, and 2021.1.15 (or later), include
[built-in support](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/play-asset-delivery.html)
for [Play Asset Delivery (PAD)](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery). These Unity versions allow
developers to specify asset packs by placing assets in .androidpack folders within their project. These versions also
change the "Split Application Binary" option to use asset packs instead of OBBs.

The build method used by the Google Play Plugins for Unity is incompatible with these features and will ignore assets placed
in the .androidpack folders.
